## Barrier Option Pricing
This code simulates the pricing of a Barrier Option using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model for the underlying asset’s price dynamics. Barrier options are contingent on the underlying asset breaching a predetermined barrier level during the option’s lifetime. The code evaluates a Knock-Out barrier option using Monte Carlo simulation.
